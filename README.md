## Description

This repository contains the code for my university project, titled "MySongs". The project aims to provide musician with app that can enable them to store on their profile songs that they know how to play on guitar, bass guitar and drums. It was developed as part of Web programming course at Economic Faculty in Subotica, University of Novi Sad. This is a project in development. It is a work in progress, and I am actively working on it to enhance its functionality and features.
